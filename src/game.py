    # Level 1:  Implement the Blue Ghost using Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to chase Pac-Man

    # Level 2: Implement the Pink Ghost using the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm to chase Pac-Man.

    # Level 3: Implement the Orange Ghost using the Uniform-Cost Search algorithm to chase Pac-Man.

    # Level 4: Implement the Red Ghost using the A* Search (A*) algorithm to chase Pac-Man.

    # Level 5: Implement all ghosts (Blue, Pink, Orange, and Red) moving simultaneously in the same maze,
# each ghost follows its respective search algorithm to chase Pac-Man and executes independently.

    # Level 6: Enable interactive game-play by allowing the player to control Pac-Manâ€™s movement while
# the ghosts actively chase him.
